# Mattworld

Ultra hardcore RimWorld with Matt. Made for https://www.twitch.tv/edopeh

### The Challenge

The mod offers you a challenge that is the same for everyone. The random seed comes from the current year+month so you get a new setup every month.

### What to expect

Starting a new game will skip all setup and will set up the game like Edopeh does: Naked brutality, 500% loosing is fun, Randy Random.  
Additionally, colonist traits and stats are nerfed and the start location on the 100% world is chosen in a tough way. As with Edo, the only male colonist will be called "Matt".

### Is it hard?

Yes, I doubt anybody can play this and leave the planet. If its too hard, sorry, there are no customizations or settings.

### License

Free. As in free beer. Copy, learn and be respectful.
